    Header for the value component, representing a value containing either integer functionality or string functionality.
    Provides methods and a value for each value struct.
    Provides functions to parse integers and strings for provided textual input.
    This functionality is used in map to work with each value struct.
    This functionality is also used in driver to parse integers and strings from values.
